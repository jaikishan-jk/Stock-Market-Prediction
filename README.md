# Stock-Market-Prediction
<p>Project Description: Stock market prediction using LSTM

Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the future price of a stock using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

Methodology: To achieve this goal, we will first collect historical data for the stock of interest. This data will include the stock's price, volume traded, and other relevant features. We will then pre-process the data to prepare it for use in our model. This may include normalizing the data, imputing missing values, and creating new features through feature engineering.

Next, we will split the pre-processed data into training and test sets. The training set will be used to train the LSTM model, while the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance. We will use a variety of techniques to optimize the model's hyperparameters and ensure that it is able to generalize well to unseen data.

Once the model has been trained and evaluated, we will use it to make predictions on the future price of the stock. These predictions can be used by investors to inform their trading decisions.

Expected Results: We expect that the LSTM model will be able to make more accurate predictions on the future price of the stock than traditional statistical models. We will evaluate the model's performance using a variety of metrics, such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error.

Conclusion: This project has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of stock market predictions, which can benefit investors and help inform financial decision making.</p>
